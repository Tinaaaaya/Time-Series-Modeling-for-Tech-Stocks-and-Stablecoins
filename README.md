# Time Series Analysis of Tech Stocks and Stablecoins

## Research Overview and Methodology

This study analyzes the daily trading data of Apple's stock (AAPL), Nasdaq 100 Index Fund (QQ) and TEDA stable currency (USDT) in the past year, aiming at understanding their income dynamics, volatility characteristics and cross-market correlation. The analysis framework is promoted from univariate characteristic system to multivariate relationship, and logarithmic rate of return is adopted to ensure stationarity and comparability between assets. 

The methodology system includes descriptive statistics to describe distribution characteristics, Ljung-Box test to evaluate market efficiency under random walk hypothesis, autoregressive model to capture short-term persistence, GARCH norm modeling time-varying volatility, quantification of tail risk exposure of value at risk, and correlation and regression analysis to explore cross-asset dependence.

**This study treats stablecoins as a test case for the transferability of traditional stock-market time-series models, examining whether financial and economic patterns observed in equity markets remain valid under algorithmic price stabilization.**

## Key Empirical Findings

The visualization of price series reveals a completely different running track. AAPL experienced significant fluctuations, and partially recovered after a significant retracement in April 2025, while QQ showed a sustained upward trend from 430 to 560, reflecting the overall strength of the science and technology sector. USDT maintains excellent stability near the dollar anchor, with only minimal deviation, which proves its design goal. The yield distribution exposes the fundamental differences in risk characteristics. Both AAPL and QQ show significant positive skewness (0.58 and 0.70) and extreme excess kurtosis (12.44 and 11.00), which indicates that the thick tail feature and the probability of extreme events far exceed the normal distribution prediction. QQ chart confirms these deviations, and the observed values systematically deviate from the theoretical line at both ends. In contrast, USDT shows near-zero skewness (0.05) and low kurtosis (2.24), and the yield is highly concentrated near zero, although the QQ chart reveals that even this supposedly stable asset has a slight tail thickness.

Autocorrelation analysis provides evidence for market efficiency and predictability. The ACF values of AAPL and QQ hover around zero in all lag periods, and there is no significant peak beyond the confidence interval, which supports the random walk hypothesis and weak market efficiency. Ljung-Box test p values of 0.120 and 0.191 failed to reject the hypothesis of uncorrelated primitive. USDT presents a completely different pattern, and the first-order negative autocorrelation reaches-0.307, which shows an obvious downward peak in ACF diagram. This mean regression behavior reflects that the stability mechanism of the algorithm corrects the dollar anchoring deviation, and the Ljung-Box p value of 0.000000008 decisively rejects the random walk behavior.

The square return ACF chart reveals that all three assets have significant volatility aggregation. AAPL and QQ show significant positive autocorrelation in multiple lag periods, indicating that large price fluctuations tend to aggregate with time. The rolling volatility chart confirms this. In April 2025, the volatility of AAPL soared from 1-2% to over 5%, while the peak of QQ volatility was close to 3.5%. Even USDT shows time-varying volatility from 0.01% to 0.06%, although it is far below the stock level. GARCH(1,1) conditional volatility estimation has a significant effect on tracking the realized volatility of two stocks. AAPL persistence parameter of 0.950 and QQ persistence parameter of 0.954 indicate that the volatility shock attenuation is extremely slow. GARCH diagram of USDT shows essentially flat lines, because the model converges to constant variance, and both alpha and beta are close to zero.

Cross-asset relationships reveal important patterns of decentralization and contagion. The correlation thermogram shows a strong co-movement of 0.73 between AAPL and QQ, which shows a clear linear relationship in the scatter plot. This high correlation limits the diversification benefits exposed in the technology sector. AAPL-USDT correlation is negligible at 0.04, while QQQ-USDT shows a moderate but significant correlation of 0.24, suggesting that broad market trends affect the dynamics of stable currencies through risk emotional channels. Regression analysis confirmed that the yield of QQ significantly predicted the USDT trend in the same period, with a coefficient of 0.00633(p<0.001), although only 5.7% R-squared indicated that most of the USDT variation originated from specific factors of cryptocurrency. Lag regression shows negative coefficient, which accords with mean regression, but only explains less than 2% variance.

## Implications for Portfolio Management

These findings are of direct significance to risk management and asset allocation. The heavy-tailed distribution and high GARCH persistence of stock assets require dynamic volatility prediction and very variance assumption, because the current volatility system tends to be persistent. Historical VaR exceeds parameter VaR at extreme confidence level, which proves that normal distribution underestimates tail risk. The strong correlation between AAPL and QQ shows that investors seeking diversification must go beyond the boundaries of science and technology sectors. Although USDT provides significantly lower volatility, its non-zero correlation with QQ and ARCH effect evidence show that it does not provide complete isolation from stock market pressure. 

Risk managers should realize that the stability of stable currency is algorithmic rather than absolute, and mean regression occurs in multiple periods rather than instantaneous. The combination of high stock volatility persistence and cross-market correlation supports the integration of time-varying risk estimation in portfolio construction and the diversification strategy of rebalancing across fundamentally different asset classes rather than within sectors.
